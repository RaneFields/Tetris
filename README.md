## Description

This project was built as a result of a 4-day collaborative effort by students of [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/) in order to test our knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We chose to recreate Tetris because it seemed like a challenging enough goal to be interesting and rewarding, but still doable with our current knowledge and timeframe.

## How To Play

You can find the game hosted here on github at https://thebigtaco.github.io/Tetris/

#### Controls

* Left/Right arrows move the block left and right
* Down arrow moves the block down one step
* Spacebar makes the block fall instantly into place
* R restarts the game
* M mutes the music
* P pauses the game

#### Goal

Fill an entrie row with blocks to remove it, and survive as long a possible without letting blocks pile up to the top of the screen.
